## Description
Minesweeper AI is a program that automates gameplay for the classic Minesweeper game. It uses pattern recognition and logical inference to efficiently solve boards, achieving success rates of 60% on beginner boards (8x8 with 10 mines) and 50% on intermediate boards (16x16 with 40 mines).
